# Golang Coding Challenges

## Brief
A while back, I was considering learning GoLang, and the time has come... 
This is a monorepo for my golang learning, based on the challenges by John Cricket https://codingchallenges.fyi/, it's focused on building real world apps and the challenges are language agnostic, the intention is to practice and follow GoLang's best practices. Visit their documentation on https://go.dev/doc/effective_go.

Using Gofmt to format code, read more on https://go.dev/blog/gofmt.
